### Provide *full path* of input sample folder here
INPUT_DIR:
   /home/user/popinSnake/example_data/

### Provide selected sample names from input sample folder (optional)
# If sample names are not provided, workflow will automatically look for samples.bam and samples.bai under input_dir
# all samples found under input_dir will be analyzed
SAMPLES:
   # - S0001
   # - S0002
   # - S0003

### Provide *full path* of where your workflow is located
# this path will be a prefix for submodules and log files within the workflow
# e.g.: /home/user/popinSnake
WORKFLOW_PATH:
   /home/user/popinSnake/

### Provide *full path* of where you wish the analyzed output to be stored
# this path is a prefix for WORK_DIR and RESULTS_DIR
# e.g.: /home/user/../output
OUTPUT_PATH:
   /home/user/output_path/

### Choose workflow behaviour here
SICKLE:
   "yes"
ASSEMBLER:
   "minia"
ANALYSIS:
   "yes"

### Define contamination removal module
remove_contamination:
   "yes"
# Provid an alternative reference genome after contamination removal to ensure that cleaned reads are accurately realigned
ALTREF:
   /home/user/popinSnake/example_data/altref/chr21_remap.fa
# Define the *full path* of where the kraken database is installed
kraken_db_path:
   /home/user/popinSnake/example_data/kraken_db/
# deprecated parameters for snakefile download_krakendb
# check readme file for more information on how to download krakendb
# Pipeline to automatically download the chosen kraken database
#install_kraken_db:
#   "no"
#kraken_lib:
#   "https://genome-idx.s3.amazonaws.com/kraken/k2_standard_08gb_20240605.tar.gz"

### Define other workflow parameter values here
receive_email_notifications: "no" # choose between "yes" or "no" to receive email notifications or not
email: "user@example.com" # specify your email address here to receive email notifications before each notebook execution.
kmerlength: 29  # for velvet assembly
k_merge: 63     # for rule popins2_merge_contigs
readlen: 150    # for rules popins2_place_refalign and popins2_place_splitalign
min-qual: 30    # for rule popins2_crop_unmapped, Minimum average quality value in windows for read quality trimming.
min-read-len: 60 # for rule popins2_crop_unmapped, Minimum read length to keep the read after quality trimming.


# Sub-directories for OUTPUT_PATH
# These folders will be automatically created after snakemake execution
# WORK_DIR includes intermediate output, processed data
# RESUTLS_DIR includes analyzed output, final results
WORK_DIR:
   workdir
RESULTS_DIR:
   results

# Binaries from container setup
# Define paths to binaries if use submodules instead of container env:
# (Change only if you are not using the default installation locations.)
